phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in [PHP](https://php.net/), intended to handle the administration of [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL and MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.

phpMyAdmin comes with a wide range [of documentation](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/docs/) and users are welcome to update [our wiki pages](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/wiki) to share ideas and howtos for various operations. The [phpMyAdmin team](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/team/) will try to help you if you face any problem; you can use [a variety of support channels](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/support/) to get help.

phpMyAdmin is also very deeply documented in a book written by one of the developers â€“ [Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective MySQL Management](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-phpmyadmin-34-effective-mysql-management), which is available in English and [Spanish](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/docs/#books).

To ease usage to a wide range of people, phpMyAdmin is being translated into [72 languages](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/translations/) and supports both LTR and RTL languages.

phpMyAdmin is a mature project with a stable and flexible code base; you can find out more about the [project and its history](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/about/) and the [awards](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/awards/) it earned. When the project turned 15, we published a [celebration page](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/15-years/).

The phpMyAdmin project is a member of [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/). SFC is a not-for-profit organization that helps promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects.
